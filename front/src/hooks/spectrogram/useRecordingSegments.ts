/**
 * The `useRecordingSegments` hook provides functionality to compute and manage
 * segments of a spectrogram window for a given recording.
 *
 * @description
 * This function is designed to determine an optimal spectrogram segment to
 * load for displaying a requested spectrogram window to the user. The
 * selected segment is chosen to be as small as possible, minimizing data
 * loading time. However, it must be large enough to cover the entire
 * spectrogram window. Once a suitable segment size is chosen, the entire
 * spectrogram is divided into segments of the specified size with a fixed
 * stride. The function returns the segment that best covers the given window.
 * This design facilitates the browser's ability to reuse cached images of
 * previously loaded segments, optimizing performance. Additionally,
 * contiguous next and previous segments are returned, allowing the client to
 * preload these segments for smoother transitions, eliminating loading times
 * during navigation of the spectrogram.
